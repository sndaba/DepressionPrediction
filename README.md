Depression is a prevailing mental disturbance affecting an individualâ€™s thinking and mental development. According to WHO in 2022, approximately 1 billion people have mental disorders and over 300 million people suffer from depression worldwide. Depression prevails in suicidal thoughts in an individual. Around 800,000 people commit suicide annually. Therefore, it requires a comprehensive response to deal with the burden of mental health issues. NPOs like Botswana Network for Mental Health and Embrace Emotions Support Network in Botswana, and UK organisations like Mind and Depression UK offer counseling and psychological therapies to help individuals and families dealing with depression. Machine learning aims at creating algorithms that are equipped with the ability to train themselves to perceive complex patterns. This ability helps to find solutions to new problems by using previous data and solutions.
